      <h3>EDI</h3>
<p> Course Relevance: Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in
    areas of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched
    with semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve
    socially relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially
    relevant domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy
    and Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select
    relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and
    enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern
    world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are
    prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active
    learning and inquiry-based learning. Project centric learning will also redefine the role of teacher as
    mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question,
    challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve. It brings students not only to know,
    understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze, design and apply categories of Bloom’s
    Taxonomy.</p>    </div>
